# 4 on a row
## Description

My First Project. A small terminal version of 4 in a row.
Made in Python.

## How works

Enter the number corresponding to a box. You win when you get a line with your brand.

The concept of the game is that it works like traditional 4 in a row which, unlike tik tak toe, is affected by gravity. The latter is what the program emulates.
