## Description

My First Project. A small terminal version of 4 on a row.

Made in Python.

## How works

Enter the number corresponding to a box. You win when you get a line with your brand.

The concept of the game is the used in "connect four", unlike tik tak toe, is affected by gravity.

The latter is what the program emulates.

## Notes about the project

<ul>
<li>This program uses a 7x6 board, like the original connect four game.</li>
<li>Now, the program uses an if sequences for each mark for analize a winning situation.</li>
<li>Dashboard display needs a cosmetic makeover. </li>
<li>I'm thinking of upgrading to a graphical mode, but I want to work on the details of the terminal mode until it works in optimal conditions.</li>
</ul>
