## Description

My First Project. A small terminal version of 4 on a row.

Made in Python.

## How works

Enter the number corresponding to a box. You win when you get a line with your brand.

The concept of the game is that it works like traditional 4 in a row which, unlike tik tak toe, is affected by gravity.

The latter is what the program emulates.

## Notes about the project

<ul>
<li>This program uses a 4x4 board, but the original 4 in a row board is 7x6<./li>
<li>Win checking uses an if sequence, but theoretically an optimal solution is to implement a loop that checks for wins.</li>
<li>Dashboard display needs a cosmetic makeover.</li>
<li>I'm thinking of upgrading to a graphical mode, but I want to work on the details of the terminal mode until it works in optimal conditions.</li>
</ul>
